# Deployement

# Description

This is an implementation of a game called Sokoban. Originally made in the 1980s this game was a hit in Japan and released in many countries worldwide.
The game has a simple purpose - to complete all 50 levels by pushing all the objects into storing locations. It's best controlled with the arrow keys on a keyboard but this implementation features a virtual controller and is responsive, making it playable on any device that has a screen.

# User accounts

Only the first level of the game is accessible without creating an account. Accounts can be created with an email and password and optionally a name.

# Scores

The game stores high scores for individual users, as well as globally. The global high scores can be seen by anyone but only a logged in user can see their personal high scores.
